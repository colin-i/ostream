O Stream is a program used to edit, capture, view, play, search and save media. Create slide shows and tutorials with lots of video effects and add music files to them. For that you can use the mkv, avi or mp4 output format with the MJPEG compression, raw I420 (YUV,4:2:0), MPEG4 ASP or MPEG4 AVC encoder and encode audio with MP3(layer3,mpeg1) in mp4 files.
